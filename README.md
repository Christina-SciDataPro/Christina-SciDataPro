- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Data Scientist
- ðŸ”­ I'm developing a generative AI model that creates realistic artwork based on user input. By training the model on a diverse dataset of paintings, drawings, and other visual artworks, I aim to enable users to generate unique and visually appealing images with just a few clicks. This project explores the intersection of art and technology, offering users a new way to express their creativity and inspire artistic exploration."
